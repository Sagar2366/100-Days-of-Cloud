Day 2 of #100daysofcloud & #100daysofcybersecurity is a Python script to locate any default VPCs in any AWS Region in your *current* Account. Script is in the attached Carbon Screenshot. I'll begin porting these to GitHub soon.

Every single AWS Account out there has default VPCs created in every Region, there are a lot of AWS services such as RDS, Neptune, Redshift, SageMaker, EC2, and so forth that look for the Default VPC to attach to. It's meant to help you out but is a relic of a bygone era when the hardest thing you may have had to do was properly create a VPC with Public & Private Subnets and not blackhole your NATGW lol.

Now with landing zones, IAC, and endless templates and console wizards there is hardly a need for it. While a vast majority of AWS incidents I have been involved in use an identity vector, there are still some that use the network vector especially for your "garden snake" variety attack like cryptojacking. Attackers will spin up massive ECS, EKS or EC2 fleets and mine. I've also seen SFTP servers hosted in a different Region go undetected as the adversary used it to exfiltrate data from within the trust boundary.

This is a big deal because the major detective controls in AWS are all Regional. Even if you use multi-region CloudTrail, would you be able to tell 100% that a Create operation is malicious? Are you even monitoring CloudTrail or just dumping it off? Maybe the IP Address will give it away - since the attacker needs to gain Initial Access first - but can you build an ML workload to detect anomalies between identities & IP addresses accurately?

Interestingly enough, there is not a cloud network oriented Technique/Sub-Technique in MITRE ATT&CK. The closest you get is T1583.003: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server for Resource Development / living-off-the-land and for Persistence this is an identity-related one but, T1078.004: Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts.

Day 3 I'll show you how to delete them and in the future we will have multi-account use cases. For this one you need ec2:DescribeVpcs and ec2:DescribeRegions permissions only.
