Day 16 of #100daysofcloud & #100daysofcybersecurity don't have much for you all today except for a reformatting of the GitHub. 

Makes it way easier to read (I think) and puts the snippets into proper files partitioned by day. I am also getting rid of archiving the random screenshots I attach to the posts - not sure if it's doing anything good for my post engagement as it's nose-dived lately.

Will be working through WAF for the next few days - coming up with a finalized script along with importing Managed Rules Sets and show you some secret sauce on building a few SQL Injection rules. Will go into centralized logging, how to process the logs, and maybe some data transformation for you Lake Parquet People lol.

After that not sure if I'll go down the FMS path or get into VPC Flow Logging and messing with a few ways to automate deployment & centralized collection of Flow Logs. I've not used Network Firewall in a long time so I am not too well equipped to go into that, but who knows what the next few weeks will hold.

Will finish up the network security angle by getting a bit more into some recon/scanning tools like WhatWeb, NMAP and ZAP as well to automate scans & test.

Past that, will likely get into container security, different tools to automate, CI pipeline testing, how to write proper Dockerfiles, and may even do something stupid with SBOMs. Will find time to touch on IAM as well which is exhaustive so not sure what to do yet. I've also gotten in requests about backups/DR - testing, creating snapshots, and what not.

Part of me also wants to do some endpoint & CTI stuff - I've had a lot of experience messing with Wazuh, MISP, and other general #SecDataOps and #BI things too. Who knows. This format means I cannot be too exhaustive so expect to see concepts spread across days / weeks depending on the complexity.

By the end of this hopefully there will be enough content to keep lean-running security teams on AWS afloat for quite a while....

For those of you who have followed this everyday thanks for the support. I do this 10% to remember to engage on LinkedIn but 90% to impart the small bit of knowledge I have to everyone - I don't think there is a single AWS security analyst/engineer/architect who hasn't at least asked themselves once to do at least one small thing I've done/am doing.
